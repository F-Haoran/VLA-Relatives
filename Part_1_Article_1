Part I Articles About LLM/NLP 
(The notes are based on understanding of articles)
  Article 1: Attention Is All You Need.[1]

    1. Background:
      (1)Convolutional Neural Networks:
        Example: Image->(Convolution->ReLU->Pooling)->(Convolution->ReLU->Pooling)->Output
      (2)Recurrent Neural Networks:
        Example: I am a person(with Memory).

    2. General Model: (with ReLU behind each Sublayer)
      Encoder:
        Sublayer1: Multi-head self-attention
        Sublayer2: Feed forward
      Decoder:
        Sublayer1: Multi-head self-attention
        Sublayer2: Multi-head self-attention with output from Encoder
        Sublayer3: Feed forward
       
    3.Sublayers:
      Single-head Attetion: Using the formula in article.
      Multi-head Attention: Doing multiple attentions at same time.
      Feed forward: F_2(F_1(x))where F_1(x) and F_2(x) are w_j · x + b_j

   4. Attention: 
      Queries, Keys of dimensions and Values of dimensions:
      Example: In the library, I wish to find a book, named as "Attention".(Query)
               The library has keyword: "attention".(Key)
               The library knows position of this book, Attention.(Value)
               Using Key and Query to find similarity of searching result
               Using result of them and value to calculate matches(final search results).
